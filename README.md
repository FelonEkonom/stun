# Fake TURN

**This package works only with [membrane_ice_plugin](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_ice_plugin) and it's very unlikely that you need to use it directly.**

Forked from https://github.com/processone/stun.

TURN serving as an endpoint to Membrane RTC Engine. See https://blog.swmansion.com/how-we-made-membrane-sfu-less-ice-y-34ac8ce8d97c for more information.
